// Considerations
// Take note of how the 'bottles' turns to 'bottle' at the right time
// You can certainly use while, for, each, and various other built in methods
// Challenge Yourself
// Make your code able to take in and account for any bottle amount
// Refactor your code so it doesn't use any loops or iteration whatsoever

// Exercise
// write a function that takes input from the user to have a conversation with a deafGrandma
// Deaf Grandma
// This small challenge comes from Chris Pine's "Learn to Program". Ensure that you read everything and click every link before starting the work.

// Premise
// Write a program which can imitate a Grandma who's hard of hearing and follows these constraints:

// If you don't input anything (just hit enter) she responds with WHAT?!

// If you ask a question with any lower-case letters, she responds with SPEAK UP, KID!

// If you talk to her in all upper-case letters, she responds with NO, NOT SINCE 1946!

// The first time you say GOODBYE! she says LEAVING SO SOON?

// The second time you say GOODBYE! she says LATER, SKATER! and the program exits.

// Example
// HEY KID!
// > hi, grandma
// SPEAK UP, KID!
// > I SAID HI, GRANDMA
// NO, NOT SINCE 1946!
// >
// WHAT?!
// > Goodbye!
// SPEAK UP, KID!
// > GOODBYE!
// LEAVING SO SOON?
// > GOODBYE!
// LATER, SKATER!
